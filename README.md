Several projects in python I made as part of a Coursera course with Python.

Install requirements using virtualenv and pip.

Instructions on how to use virtualenv here:
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Run the following command after installing virtualenv and pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install SimpleGUITk, Pillow, Pygame, and matplotlib.

ISSUES:
I've had trouble getting matplotlib to be installed via pip on os x mavericks. Please message me if you find a solution.

Requirements:

SimpleGUITk: Wrapper developed using Tkinter to replace the simplegui tool used in the python course.

Pillow: Used to make images work in SimpleGUITk

Pygame: Used to make sounds work in SimpleGUITk

matplotlib: Used for SimplePlot support

SimpleGUITk was not made by me.
