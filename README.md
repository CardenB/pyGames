Several projects in python I made as part of a Coursera course with Python.

Requirements:

SimpleGUITk: Wrapper developed using Tkinter to replace the simplegui tool used in the python course.

Pillow: Used to make images work in SimpleGUITk

Pygame: Used to make sounds work in SimpleGUITk

matplotlib: Used for SimplePlot support

SimpleGUITk can be downloaded here:

SimpleGUITk was not made by me.
